# Redhat-System-Administration-Using-TUI
This tool is something which can be used by RedHat System Administration for monitoring and performing some basic tasks on the main system as well as remote system also. Combining Python3 and Linux knowledge to build a Text-based User Interface from which you can moniter and configure Redhat Linux 8 ( or other rpm based Linux distros ) without any Linux knowledge. 

Also I have used some of the Object Oriented Programming Concepts to build this application.

In  this repository different modules are being created but all are linked to MainMenu.py So we need to run MainMenu.py 

To run the Application in terminal 
run "python3 MainMenu.py" in Your Terminal.

When you Run the application it will ask for Username and Password.<br>
Username is "authority"<br>
Password is "abhinav"
<br><br><br>

NOTE :<b> I AM STILL WORKING ON THIS PROJECT</b>
